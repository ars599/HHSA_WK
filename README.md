[1]  Bedrosian Theorem Let f(x) and g(x) denotes generally complex functions in L 2 (-∞, ∞) of the real variable x. If (1) the Fourier transform F(ω) of f(x) vanished for │ω│> a and the Fourier transform G(ω) of g(x) vanishes for │ω│< a, where a is an arbitrary positive constant, or (2) f(x) and g(x) are analytic (i. e., their real and imaginary parts are Hilbert pairs), then the Hilbert transform of the product of f(x) and g(x) is given H { f(x) g(x) } = f(x) H { g(x) }.
